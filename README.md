### Hi there 👋 I'm S Sonika!

💻 Software Developer | 🛠️ Tech Enthusiast | 🤖 AI & ML Learner

I'm a passionate software developer with a strong interest in building scalable and efficient web applications. I love crafting robust **RESTful APIs**, designing clean **frontend interfaces**, and automating infrastructure to make development smoother and faster.

My core technical strengths lie in **Python**, **Java**, **JavaScript**, and frameworks like **FastAPI**, **Spring Boot**, and **React**. I'm also well-versed in working with both **relational (MySQL)** and **non-relational (MongoDB)** databases, allowing me to handle a wide range of data-driven projects.

Whether it's backend development, full-stack web apps, or DevOps automation, I’m always excited to solve real-world problems with clean and efficient code.
