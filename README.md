### Hi there 👋 I'm S Sonika!

💻 Software Developer | 🛠️ Tech Enthusiast | 🤖 AI & ML Learner

- I'm a passionate software developer with a strong interest in building scalable and efficient applications. I enjoy diving into complex problems and turning them into clean, working systems and automating infrastructure to make development smoother and faster.<br>

- My core technical strengths lie in **Python**, **Java**, **JavaScript**, and frameworks like **FastAPI**, **Spring Boot**, and **React** and and **Node.js**. I'm also well-versed in working with both **relational (MySQL)** and **non-relational (MongoDB)** databases, allowing me to handle a wide range of data-driven projects.<br>
  
- I also have experience in **infrastructure automation with Ansible** and **browser automation using Selenium**, which allows me to streamline deployment processes and ensure software quality through test automation.<br>

- Whether it's developing full-stack web apps, DevOps automation, or exploring various fields I’m always excited to solve real-world problems with clean and efficient code.<br>
